# \#365papers

I am going to have a go at documenting my paper reading for 2016. I won't necessarily do 365 papers but it's a nice goal. I'll add a sentence summarising the paper and sometimes a little more detailed notes.  

1. Beche, L., McElravy, E., Resh, V., 2006. Long-term seasonal variation in the biological traits of benthic-macroinvertebrates in two Mediterranean-climate streams in California, U.S.A. Freshwater Biology 51, 56â€“75. http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01473.x. Beche et al. looked at seasonal variability in one intermittent and one perennial Californian Mediterranean stream. There was considerable seasonal turnover, with distinct communities present between the two seasons - more evident in the intermittent stream. They showed that despite high seasonal variation in abundance and composition of benthic invertebrates, there was much less variation in the traits (i.e. greater seasonal stability). However, interannual variation in rainfall influenced the effect of seasonality within years. i.e. There was greater variation between seasons in wet compared to dry years.

2. Review for journal.
