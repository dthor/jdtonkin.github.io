# \#365papers

As per the twitter [\#365papers](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23365papers) hashtag, I am going to have a go at documenting my paper reading for 2016. I won't necessarily do 365 papers but it's a nice goal. I'll add a sentence summarising the paper and sometimes a little more detailed notes.  

1. **Beche, L., McElravy, E., Resh, V., 2006. Long-term seasonal variation in the biological traits of benthic-macroinvertebrates in two Mediterranean-climate streams in California, U.S.A. Freshwater Biology 51, 56–75.** [DOI:10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01473.x](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01473.x). Beche et al. looked at seasonal variability in one intermittent and one perennial Californian Mediterranean stream. There was considerable seasonal turnover, with distinct communities present between the two seasons - more evident in the intermittent stream. They showed that despite high seasonal variation in abundance and composition of benthic invertebrates, there was much less variation in the traits (i.e. greater seasonal stability). However, interannual variation in rainfall influenced the effect of seasonality within years. i.e. There was greater variation between seasons in wet compared to dry years.

3. **Dalby, L., McGill, B.J., Fox, A.D., Svenning, J.-C., 2014. Seasonality drives global-scale diversity patterns in waterfowl (Anseriformes) via temporal niche exploitation. Global Ecology and Biogeography 23, 550–562.** [DOI:10.1111/geb.12154](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.12154). A look at global patterns in waterfowl diversity. Essentially shows that the mid-latitude peak in waterfowl diversity is a function of temporal niche exploitation. The areas with richness peak were dominated by migratory species in both breeding and non-breeding seasons. This reflects shifting environmental conditions, i.e. intra-annual variability and seasonal productivity. Previous work (Hurlbert and Haskell, 2003) demonstrated North American birds track plant production similarly in both breeding and non-breeding seasons - exploiting temporally available niches. Hurlbert and Haskell (2003) also found the greatest number of migrants with the largest seasonal shifts in productivity. This also backs up early predictions (e.g. MacArthur, 1959; Herrera, 1978) that the most seasonal environments (those with the greatest difference in productivity between seasons) will support the highest number of migrants. 

4. **Bogan, M.T., Lytle, D.A., 2011. Severe drought drives novel community trajectories in desert stream pools. Freshwater Biology 56, 2070–2081.** [DOI:10.1111/j.1365-2427.2011.02638.x](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2011.02638.x). Document a catastrophic regime shift in the community of arid-land stream pools corresponding to a shift from perennial to intermittent. Communities did not show any sign of recovery in the four years post-drought. Pre-drying, richness and composition oscillated seasonally between low- and high-flow seasons. Post-drying, abundances were much higher, which may somewhat reflect extirpation of large-bodied predators.

5. **Bogan, M.T., Boersma, K.S., Lytle, D.A., 2013. Flow intermittency alters longitudinal patterns of invertebrate diversity and assemblage composition in an arid-land stream network. Freshwater Biology 58, 1016–1028.** [DOI:10.1111/fwb.12105](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/fwb.12105). Invertebrate richness was lowest in intermittent reaches, but intermittent reaches harbored distinct taxa with adaptations to intermittency (e.g. egg and⁄or larval diapause). Thus, intermittent reaches contributed clearly to regional diversity. Predators were much more abundant in perennial than in intermittent reaches. 

6. **Shimadzu, H., Dornelas, M., Henderson, P. a, Magurran, A.E., 2013. Diversity is maintained by seasonal variation in species abundance. BMC biology 11, 98.** [DOI:10.1186/1741-7007-11-98](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1741-7007-11-98). Use 30-y data of monthly sampled estuarine fish assemblage. Seasonal fluctuations in species abundance allow coexistence. Species fall into distinct seasonal groups. Interestingly, this reflects the four seasons, not just a wet-dry or summer-winter pattern. Seasonal variation in richness and evenness linked to shifts in resource availability. Essentially, spatiotemporal shifts in community composition minimize competitive interactions and help stabilize total abundance.

8. **Corliss, B.H., Brown, C.W., Sun, X., Showers, W.J., 2009. Deep-sea benthic diversity linked to seasonality of pelagic productivity. Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers 56, 835–841.** [DOI:10.1016/j.dsr.2008.12.009](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsr.2008.12.009). Documented latitudinal patterns of North Atlantic deep-sea benthic foraminifera. Fits the typical latitudinal diversity gradient. Regions with low seasonality and more stable food input over an annual cycle have higher diversity, a more even distribution of species and higher richness.
