# \#365papers

As per the twitter (\#365papers)[https://twitter.com/search?q=%23365papers] hashtag, I am going to have a go at documenting my paper reading for 2016. I won't necessarily do 365 papers but it's a nice goal. I'll add a sentence summarising the paper and sometimes a little more detailed notes.  

1. **Beche, L., McElravy, E., Resh, V., 2006. Long-term seasonal variation in the biological traits of benthic-macroinvertebrates in two Mediterranean-climate streams in California, U.S.A. Freshwater Biology 51, 56–75.** [DOI:10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01473.x](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01473.x). Beche et al. looked at seasonal variability in one intermittent and one perennial Californian Mediterranean stream. There was considerable seasonal turnover, with distinct communities present between the two seasons - more evident in the intermittent stream. They showed that despite high seasonal variation in abundance and composition of benthic invertebrates, there was much less variation in the traits (i.e. greater seasonal stability). However, interannual variation in rainfall influenced the effect of seasonality within years. i.e. There was greater variation between seasons in wet compared to dry years.

2. **Review for journal.**

3. **Dalby, L., McGill, B.J., Fox, A.D., Svenning, J.-C., 2014. Seasonality drives global-scale diversity patterns in waterfowl (Anseriformes) via temporal niche exploitation. Global Ecology and Biogeography 23, 550–562.** [DOI:10.1111/geb.12154](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.12154). A look at global patterns in waterfowl diversity. Essentially shows that the mid-latitude peak in waterfowl diversity is a function of temporal niche exploitation. The areas with richness peak were dominated by migratory species in both breeding and non-breeding seasons. This reflects shifting environmental conditions, i.e. intra-annual variability and seasonal productivity. Previous work (Hurlbert and Haskell, 2003) demonstrated North American birds track plant production similarly in both breeding and non-breeding seasons - exploiting temporally available niches. Hurlbert and Haskell (2003) also found the greatest number of migrants with the largest seasonal shifts in productivity. This also backs up early predictions (e.g. MacArthur, 1959; Herrera, 1978) that the most seasonal environments (those with the greatest difference in productivity between seasons) will support the highest number of migrants.
