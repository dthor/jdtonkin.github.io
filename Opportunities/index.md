# Prospective students

I am always on the lookout for hard-working, highly motivated students with a passion for ecology and freshwater ecosystems. If you’ve had a look around my website and you’re interested in working with me, please do get in touch. Likewise, if you have an idea for a project, flick me an email at [jonathan.tonkin[at]senckenberg.de](mailto:jonathan.tonkin@senckenberg.de) or [jdtonkin[at]gmail.com](mailto:jdtonkin@gmail.com) including a brief introduction of your experience, research interests and goals.
