I recently gave a talk on some work I've been doing at Senckenberg looking at regional patterns in stream invertebrate assemblages. I upscaled the Elements of Metacommunity Structure (EMS) approach to examine patterns in biodiversity. Below is a copy of the talk from [figshare](http://figshare.com/). Feel free to fire away any questions. The manuscript is currently in review with PLOS ONE.
