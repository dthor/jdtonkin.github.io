I'm really excited to share that in a couple of months, I'll be moving with my family to the US. I will start a new postdoc at [Oregon State University](http://oregonstate.edu/) based in [Corvallis](http://visitcorvallis.com/), Oregon.

I'll be working with Dr. Dave Lytle in the [Lytle Lab](http://lytlelab.science.oregonstate.edu/) at OSU. The overall theme of the project is "Flow regimes and aquatic population modeling" with the emphasis being on exploring the ways in which climate change may affect river flows and aquatic/riparian organisms. This is a really exciting project to me and a great chance to also work with collaborators involved in the project: [Dr. Julian Olden](http://depts.washington.edu/oldenlab/) at the University of Washington and [Dr. David Merritt](http://www.fs.fed.us/research/people/profile.php?alias=dmmerritt) at USFS in Fort Collins.

Really looking forward to a productive and stimulating few years of exciting science.
