We've just had another paper accepted at [PLOS ONE](http://www.plosone.org/). This is the work that I presented at the SEFS conference in Geneva, as mentioned [here](http://jdtonkin.github.io/blog/2015/07/12/Talk-for-SEFS/), where we looked at regional patterns in stream invertebrate assemblages in central Germany. I upscaled the Elements of Metacommunity Structure (EMS) approach to examine regional patterns in biodiversity.

Below is a copy of the talk from SEFS.
