I've done a pretty poor job of keeping my publications up to date on here in the past year. In this time, I've published a bunch of new papers that you can find by going over to the [publications](/publications) page. These include work from my previous postdoc in Germany looking at scale dependent effects of river habitat quality on benthic invertebrate communities (see [blog post](https://medium.com/@jdtonkin/river-restoration-should-be-directed-at-moderately-impaired-regions-9df51f7ea50c)), the time that restoration takes to work in streams, biodiversity in tropical streams, metacommunities in Himalayan streams, and fish responses to restoration.
