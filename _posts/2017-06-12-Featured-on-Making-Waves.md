I was recently featured on the Society for Freshwater Science's [Making Waves](http://www.freshwater-science.org/Education-and-Outreach/Media/Podcast.cfm) podcast. This was a really great opportunity to share some recent research of ours, including our paper on seasonality and some of our recent population modeling work. You can find the podcast [here](https://youtu.be/mqnuv6YZBSM).
