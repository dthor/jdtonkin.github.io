I'm very excited to announce that I have recently joined the Editorial Board of [Freshwater Biology](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1365-2427). I've always thought of Freshwater Biology as the flagship freshwater specific journal, so I'm super excited and honoured by the opportunity to be a part of the team there.
