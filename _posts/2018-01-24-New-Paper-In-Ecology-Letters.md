We recently published a paper in [Ecology Letters](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.12866) where we develop a model to explore the countervailing effects of disturbance on population dynamics. In this paper, we derived a novel form of the logistic growth equation that permits time-varying carrying capacity and growth rate.
