I study factors that promote and maintain biodiversity from a community, metacommunity and macroecological perspective. My research has mostly focused on running water ecosystems, but my interests are question focused, not system specific. 

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [Senckenberg](http://www.senckenberg.de/root/index.php?page_id=71) Research Institute and Natural History Museum in Germany. Iâ€™m based in the River Ecology and Conservation [Department](http://www.senckenberg.de/root/index.php?page_id=5217&organisation=true&institutID=1&abteilungID=26) in Gelnhausen, Germany. 

You can read more about [me](About), my [research](Research), and my [publications](Publications) on my website. 

Also find me on researchgate, academia.edu, figshare, google scholar, and twitter.
