You can also find the pdf [here](publications).

> <span style="color:#999">21 Oct 2015</span> » **New paper in Oikos.** Our paper looking at metacommunity structure of benthic invertebrates, riparian spiders and riparian carabids is now online at Oikos [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.02717).

> <span style="color:#999">17 Aug 2015</span> » **New paper online.** Our paper looking at regional patterns in stream invertebrate assemblages in central Germany is now online at [PLOS ONE](http://www.plosone.org/). I upscaled the Elements of Metacommunity Structure (EMS) approach to examine regional patterns in stream invertebrate biodiversity and examined influential environmental factors using boosted regression trees. You can find the paper online [here](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0135450). [Here's](https://figshare.com/articles/Environmental_controls_on_river_assemblages_at_the_regional_scale_the_importance_of_network_position/1480477) the talk I presented at SEFS earlier in the year. 

> <span style="color:#999">3 Aug 2015</span> » **New paper.** Our paper looking at multiple stressors in German streams is now online at [Science of the Total Environment](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/science-of-the-total-environment/). You can also find the pdf [here](publications). This was a project led by a PhD student in our group, Moritz Leps, who did a great job of handling such a complex dataset (1018 river sites) to get some meaningful insight into multiple stressors in these river systems. The focus of the work was looking at the impacts of multiple stressors, including water quality, riparian and catchment land use, and stream morphology, on riverine benthic invertebrate communities, while simultaneously considering the spatial scales of stressors and the heterogeneity of riverscapes.

> <span style="color:#999">19 Jul 2015</span> » **We're moving to the US!** I'm really excited to share that in a couple of months, I'll be moving with my family to the US. I will start a new postdoc at [Oregon State University](http://oregonstate.edu/) based in [Corvallis](http://visitcorvallis.com/), Oregon. I'll be working with Dr. Dave Lytle in the [Lytle Lab](http://lytlelab.science.oregonstate.edu/) at OSU. The overall theme of the project is "Flow regimes and aquatic population modeling" with the emphasis being on exploring the ways in which climate change may affect river flows and aquatic/riparian organisms. This is a really exciting project to me and a great chance to also work with collaborators involved in the project: [Dr. Julian Olden](http://depts.washington.edu/oldenlab/) at the University of Washington and [Dr. David Merritt](http://www.fs.fed.us/research/people/profile.php?alias=dmmerritt) at USFS in Fort Collins. Really looking forward to a productive and stimulating few years of exciting science.

> <span style="color:#999">24 Jul 2015</span> » **Paper accepted at Oikos.** We've just had a paper accepted for publication at [Oikos](http://www.oikosjournal.org/), thanks to some helpful comments from the reviewers and editors at Oikos. In this paper we examined metacommunity structure and beta diversity patterns of instream benthic invertebrates, riparian carabid beetles and riparian spiders in a river-floodplain system in central Germany. These sites belong to the [Rhine-Main-Observatory](http://www.senckenberg.de/root/index.php?page_id=15596) LTER site on the Kinzig River, which is part of the LTER research network in Germany ([LTER-D](http://www.lter-d.ufz.de/)), Europe ([LTER Europe](http://www.lter-europe.net/)) and worldwide ([ILTER](http://www.ilternet.edu/)). Our results indicated varying levels of mass effects and species sorting shape river-floodplain metacommunities, depending on habitat connectivity (terrestrial vs. aquatic, connected vs. fragmented) and dispersal ability (active vs. passive, terrestrial vs. aquatic). Also, the patterns we observed in metacommunity structure were reflected in patterns of beta diversity and were mostly consistent over a three year period. 

> <span style="color:#999">1 Jun 2015</span> » **Joining PeerJ Editorial Board.** I'm very excited to announce that I have recently joined the Editorial Board of [PeerJ](https://peerj.com/). I'm really looking forward to handling my first manuscript. This is a relatively new open access journal with a really interesting [pricing plan](https://peerj.com/pricing/) for open access publications. Basically it's a one-off payment of US$100 for your first publication, which allows you to publish one paper per year after that for free. For a total of US$300 you get to publish an unlimited number of papers open access for the rest of your life. My process as an author there has been super smooth, so I highly recommend PeerJ and certainly plan to continue publishing there. They also host preprints for free [here](https://peerj.com/preprints/). I currently have a few hosted there, which you can see on my [profile page](https://peerj.com/jdtonkin/).
