# Research overview


I am a computational community ecologist aiming to disentangle the mechanisms that promote and maintain biodiversity at different scales. My research crosses the disciplines of community and metacommunity ecology, and macroecology, tackling questions ranging from local to global. A strong focus of my work is searching for mechanistic links between environmental variation and population and community dynamics in highly dynamic, abiotically-forced systems. While much of my research has focused on running waters, my interests are question oriented, not system specific. I use a variety of approaches to explore these questions, including field manipulations, simulations and mining large datasets using different statistical, network and machine learning techniques.


Much of my past and ongoing research focuses on the metacommunity ecology of dendritic ecological networks. The dendritic nature of river systems can promote unique metacommunity dynamics through regulating dispersal processes. Changes in connectivity and isolation along the network of these hierarchically organized systems can lead to unique patterns of biodiversity at all scales (alpha, beta, gamma). Understanding these physical constraints on metacommunity dynamics is not limited to basic questions, but also apply to key management issues. For instance, I have shown that for restoration projects to achieve their desired ecological outcome, spatial processes such as dispersal routes and barriers, and metacommunity dynamics need to be incorporated into planning. I intend to expand this recent work by applying metacommunity theory to stream networks as a model system, including both aquatic and terrestrial organisms with different dispersal modes that depend on river networks. However, a fundamental problem often faced in stream metacommunity research is that of poor explanatory power and predictive ability. I believe that one of the central elements contributing to this problem is the stochastic nature of rivers and the lack of attention to temporal dynamics. This calls for two advancements in this area of research, which I plan to focus on the coming years: 1. More advanced modeling techniques to account for this stochastic element. 2. More complete time-series data on metacommunities. 

This focus on dynamic systems has led on to recent work exploring how temporal environmental variability (seasonality and predictability) allows for the coexistence of a great number of species through temporal niche differentiation. Currently, we seek to understand how climate change will alter such relationships in river systems. In searching for a mechanistic link between climate, streamflow and population dynamics, we are developing novel modeling techniques incorporating stochastic coupled structured population models. These models incorporate detailed stage-specific vital rates of organisms that respond to specific aspects of the hydrologic regime (floods, droughts, etc.). This "interaction neutral" modeling approach, through the omission of interactions during model parameterization, sits somewhere between neutral biodiversity models and more complete food-web models that require *a priori* pairwise interactions. A simple implementation of this model can be found at [jdtonkin.shinyapps.io/CotTam/](https://jdtonkin.shinyapps.io/CotTam/). Using network theory, we have been exploring the community-wide consequences of flow modification on river ecosystems. Network theory enables a deeper, more holistic, understanding of how organisms respond to stressors like climate change as their responses are more than the aggregate of individual responses. 

My central goal is to contribute strong advances to ecological theory in general and lead to a better understanding of the factors that promote and maintain biodiversity. Riverine systems are particularly stressed globally. Consequently, much of my work has had a strong applied focus, including river regulation, mitigating migratory fish passage through novel solutions, and river restoration. Thus, I believe strongly in applying ecological theory to effectively manage threatened ecosystems, particularly in light of the rapid rate of current global change. By bringing together ecological theory with key environmental issues, such as global change, this research will also benefit practitioners wishing to appropriately manage threatened ecological systems.
